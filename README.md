The deployment of firebase and google cloud functions can be run in the functions/index.js file. Currently, Google Cloud Functions deployed through Firebase can only be executed in a local development environment. The deployment process facilitates the hosting and scaling of functions on the cloud, but the actual execution is limited to local testing environments during development. It's important to note that for production scenarios, the functions are intended to be triggered and run on the Google Cloud Platform.
